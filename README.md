# ðŸ”‘ AES Encryptor and Decryptor
### By Isaac Katayev 

I made this for a math research paper in my 2021-2022 school year. It takes in an IV (that is 16 bytes/characters long) and a AES-128 key and encrypts plaintext, then converts the result to Base64.

Made in Python 3 and depends on Flask (web server), Pycrypto, and BS4.
